# SimpleBorderlessGames
* A simple tool to remove game/window borders &amp; position them accordingly using hotkeys.

* I created this tool using [autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) out of frustration with other solutions and their lack of hotkeys & non-fullscreen borderless/position saving (important for ultrawide displays).

* Simple Borderless Games is particularly useful for large ultrawide displays because it allows setting and saving your preferred game position/size while still allowing removal of tilebars & borders.

* Intallation:
  - Download binary from release page and run or use script manually with AHK.
  - Default keybinds:
      - <alt+h> hide borders
      - <alt+f> set position
      - <alt+g> both at once
  - Remember to enable autostart if you want to use functionality regularly.
