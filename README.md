# SimpleBorderlessGames
* A simple tool to remove game/window borders &amp; position them accordingly using hotkeys.\
\
* I created this tool using autohotkey out of frustration with other solutions and their lack of non-fullscreen borderless/position saving (important for ultrawide displays) & hotkeys.\
\
* Simple Borderless Games is particularly useful for large ultrawide displays because it allows setting and saving your preferred game position/size while still allowing removal of tilebars & borders.
